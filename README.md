### Modulang
Modulang is a modular esolang made in (C3)[https://c3-lang.org]. What I mean by modular is that it is very easy to add new instructions.

Modulang uses an array that contains 256 integers as its program memory.

## Current Instructions
```
>            ; go to the next memory cell
<            ; go to the previous memory cell
+            ; increment the current memory cell by 1
-            ; decrement the current memory cell by 1
@            ; print the current memory cell as a decimal number
p            ; print the current memory cell as an ascii character
```
